Channels in play:
	- jobs (input)
	- results (output)
	- errors (output)
	- cancel (signal)
	- done (signals no more new work)

The effect we want to create is similar to the design of io_uring
in linux

We want the main thread to perform a close on the jobs channel when
there no more work required. This closure should not interrupt the
execution of the existing workload.

The question is, do we want to use a new GR to send jobs to the pool
or do we want this to be blocking for the main GR?

1) If we have a dedicated dispatcher GR, then that implies the main thread
could freely submit all jobs it can find without being throttled. The downside
of this is that we could have a large build up of outstanding jobs resulting
in higher memory consumption. We would need a way to wait for all jobs to be
completed, ie when there are no more workers. This could be achieved with
a wait group. The problem with a wait group is that we could accidentally
reach 0 in the wait group even though there are still jobs outstanding. This is
a race condition which would arise because a job in the queue is not taken up
before all existing workers have exited. We could alleviate this by adding
an extra entry into the wait group but then how do you get down to 0?

2) Main GR sends jobs into a buffered channel and blocks when full. This seems
like the more sensible option. The main GR would be throttled by the number of
active workers and the job queue would not grow excessively consuming
memory judiciously.

However, if we have a results channel that must be read from, then we can't
have the main GR limited by the size of the worker pool, because if we do, we'll
still suffer frm the problem of memory build up, but this would be a build up
on the output, ie of the results channel.
GR(main) --> jobsCh: this is blocking after channel is full

3)

ProducerGR(observable):
	- writes to job channel

PoolGR(workers):
	- reads from job channel

ConsumerGR(observer):
	- reads from results channel
	- reads from errors channel

Both the Producer and the Consumer should be started up immediately as
separate GRs, distinct from the main GR.

	* ProducerGR(observable) --> owns the job channel and should be free to close it
	when no more work is available.

	* PoolGR(workers) --> the pool owns the output channels

So, the next question is, how does the pool know when to close the output channels?
In theory, this should be when the jobs queue is empty and the current pool of
workers is empty. This realisation now makes us discover what the worker is. The
worker is effectively a handle to the go routine which is stored in a scoped collection.
Operations on this collection should be done via a channel, where we send a pointer
to the collection thru the channel. This collection should probably be a map, whose key
is a uniquely generated ID (see "github.com/google/uuid"). When the map is empty, we
know there are no more workers active to send to the outputs, therefore we can close them.

---
- To signal an event without sending data, we can use sync.Cond. (See
page 53. ). We could use Cond to signal no more work and no more results.

- The results channel must be optional, because a client may define work in which a result
is of no value. In this case, the pool must decide how to define closure. Perhaps it creates
a dummy consumer.

// privateWpInfo contains any state that needs to be mutated in a non concurrent manner
// and therefore should be exclusively accessed by a single go routine. Actually, due to
// our ability to compose functionality with channels as opposed to shared state, the
// pool does not contain any state that is accessed directly or indirectly from other
// go routines. But in the case of the actual core pool, it is mutated without synchronisation
// and hence should only ever be accessed by the worker pool GR in contrast to all the
// other members of WorkerPool. This is an experimental pattern, the purpose of which
// is the clearly indicate what state can be accessed in different concurrency contexts,
// to ensure future updates can be applied with minimal cognitive overload.
//
// There is another purpose for privateWpInfo and that is to do with "confinement" as
// described on page 86 of CiG. The aim here is to use "lexical confinement" for
// duplex channel definitions, so although a channel is thread safe so ordinarily
// would not be a candidate member of privateWpInfo, a duplex channel ought to be
// protected from accidentally being used incorrectly, ie trying to write to a channel
// that is meant to be read only. So methods that use a channel should now receive the
// channel through a method parameter (defined as either chan<-, or <-chan), rather
// than be expected to simply access the member variable directly. This clearly signals
// that any channel defined in privateWpInfo should never to accessed directly (other
// than for passing it to another method). This is an experimental convention that
// I'm establishing for all snivilised projects.

		// part of the test spec using SpecTimeout. When this fires, this is handled by the
		// run loop, which ends that loop then enters drain. When this happens, you can't
		// reuse that same done channel as it will immediately return the value already
		// handled. This has the effect of short-circuiting this loop meaning that
		// workerID := <-finishedChIn never has a chance to be selected and the drain loop
		// exits early. The end result of which means that the p.private.pool collection is
		// never depleted.
		//
		// ‚ö†Ô∏è So an important lesson to be learnt here is that once a ctx.Done() has fired,
		// you can't reuse tha same channel in another select statement as it will simply
		// return immediately, bypassing all the others cases in the select statement.
		//
		// Some noteworthy points:
		//
		// üíé Safe Access: Accessing the Done() channel concurrently from multiple goroutines
		// is safe. Reading from a closed channel is well-defined behaviour in Go and won't
		// cause panics or issues.
		//
		// üíé Cancellation Handling: When a context is canceled, the Done() channel is closed,
		// and any goroutine waiting on the channel will be unblocked. Each goroutine needs to
		// have its own select statement to handle the context's cancellation event properly.
		//
		// üíé Synchronisation: If multiple goroutines are going to react to the context's
		// cancellation, you need to make sure that any shared resources accessed by these
		// goroutines are synchronized properly to avoid race conditions. This might involve
		// using mutexes or other synchronization primitives.
		//
		// üíé Propagation: If a goroutine creates a child context using context.WithCancel
		// or context.WithTimeout, the child goroutines should use the child context for their
		// operations instead of the parent context. This ensures that the child context's
		// cancellation doesn't affect unrelated goroutines.
		//
		// üíé Lifetime Management: Be aware of the lifetimes of the contexts and goroutines.
		// If a goroutine outlives its context or keeps references to closed Done() channels,
		// it might not behave as expected.
